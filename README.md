# Linear Models Portfolio — Regression Applications

This repository group showcases three applied machine learning projects built to develop deep intuition around linear modeling, regression assumptions, error analysis, and regularization.

The goal is not only prediction performance, but understanding when linear models succeed, where they fail, and how to diagnose their limitations.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression — Housing Prices
**Task:** Predict median house value using demographic and geographic features  
**Dataset:** California Housing (UCI / sklearn)

Focus:
- Regression fundamentals
- Feature scaling
- Residual diagnostics
- Error interpretation

Key Learning:
Linear models capture large-scale economic trends but struggle with regional nonlinearities.

---

### 2️⃣ Linear Regression — Energy Consumption
**Task:** Predict building heating load from architectural features  
**Dataset:** Energy Efficiency Dataset (UCI)

Focus:
- Multicollinearity
- Physical feature interactions
- Residual structure analysis
- Feature engineering for linear rescue

Key Learning:
Architectural geometry introduces nonlinear effects that violate linear assumptions, visible in residual curvature.

---

### 3️⃣ Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
**Task:** Stabilize linear regression under correlated predictors  
**Dataset:** Energy Efficiency Dataset (same as above)

Focus:
- Regularization impact
- Coefficient shrinkage
- Bias–variance tradeoff
- Improved generalization under multicollinearity

Key Learning:
Ridge reduces instability caused by correlated architectural variables and improves robustness.

## Why Linear Models?

Linear regression is the foundation of supervised ML:
- Simple yet powerful
- Fully interpretable
- Reveals data structure
- Teaches diagnostic thinking
- Serves as baseline for all advanced models

Understanding linear failure modes is critical before moving to tree-based or deep models.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Problem framing for regression
- Feature preprocessing & scaling
- Baseline comparison
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Residual analysis & diagnostics
- Multicollinearity handling
- Regularization (Ridge)
- Professional ML project structuring

## Next Step in the Portfolio

Following these linear projects, the natural progression is:
➡ Decision Trees & Ensemble Models  
to handle the nonlinear patterns identified here.
